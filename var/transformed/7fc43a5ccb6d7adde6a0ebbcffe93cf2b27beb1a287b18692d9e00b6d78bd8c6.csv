Additionally, ERE/0213/0001 outline planning permission was sought for 1950 homes and other development uses. This was withdrawn in July 2015. The Borough Council have now adopted a site-based Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) setting out a Masterplan for the site's redevelopment. The SPD states that an area of 60 hectares is indicated for housing development towards the centre and south-west of the site. It is the south-west section of the site that is the least affected area from contamination, to the point that residential development could occur within a five year timeframe. Provision for a primary school, sustainable drainage, open space and an internal road system will also have to be provided in this area, all of which will need to take account of the need to restore the landscape character of the dale. Design considerations will also have to take into account noise from surrounding roads and industrial uses. The site is a former iron and steel works, which is still operational in part. In relation to contaminated land, several phases of intrusive work have been undertaken historically which confirmed that ground contamination is present in soil and ground water. Confirmed contaminants on the site include heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, PAHs, sulphate, arsenic, cyanide and phenols. The range of chemicals used at the site throughout its extensive history is not fully known.
